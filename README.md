# Mr. Nobody

This is a website about an invented character called Mr Nobody. About the 
character, and as a summary, I wouldn't be able to say much. It's a rather widespead stereotype,
compared to decades or centuries ago.

The gate to the website is on index.html and the actual website files are under the __dist__ folder.
