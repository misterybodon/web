This is a website about an invented character, what I believe could be a stereotype 
of some subset of humans quite frequent on this times. 

This humans learn many things, most of them superficially, helped by the 
internet's facilities.

The gate to the website is on index.html, you can find the website on:
https://santimirandarp.github.io/mrnobody/

The pictures are taken by myself and the text in there are taken by myself. 
The code is also completely written by my own.
Some of the pictures might have some editing in GIMP (I'm on a linux 
machine).
