# mrnobody

This is a website about an invented character called Mr Nobody. About the 
character, and as a summary, I wouldn't be able to say much. It's just 
what we may call a stereotype that is quite spread all over the globe,
compared to decades or centuries ago.

The gate to the website is on index.html, you can find the website on:

Pictures, text and code, for good or bad, are my own contribution.
Some of the pictures might have some editing in GIMP.
