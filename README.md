# Mr. Nobody

This is a website about an invented character called Mr Nobody. About the 
character, and as a summary, I wouldn't be able to say much. It's a rather widespead stereotype,
compared to decades or centuries ago.

The gate to the website is on index.html and the actual website files are under the __dist__ folder.

Pictures, text and code, for good or bad, are my own contribution.


## How to edit the code

Clone the project running 

```
git clone https://github.com/misterybodon/web
```

Run 
```npm i``` 
to install dev dependencies.

`npm run watcher` will start watching for any change in the `/source` directory.

`npm run server` will reload `/dist/index.html` when there is any modification in 
the distribution folder.

Both applications (gulp-cli and live-server are supposed to be globally installed).

For specific options on running the watcher (gulp) look into `gulpfile.js`
