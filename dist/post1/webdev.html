  <h2>Thoughts on Web Dev</h2>
  <p>In the beginning of 2019 I started studying web development on my own.
  Not an easy task if you work and do stuff to make a living. You're tired,
  you forget what you've studied yesterday and get frustrated.</p> 
  <p>As many do, I feel empathetic for people running over the same
  experience, and think my testimony could be helpful for some of you.</p>

  <h3>Background</h3>
  <p><em>After graduation, the adventure</em></p>
<p>In March 2019 I was a fresh graduate bored of books and looking for new people, new
experiences, new everything. So I started backpacking around the globe. 
Being a chemist by training, I thought it easy to get temporary
contracts for chemistry-jobs on the go. That was the ideal case.
</p>
<p>Reality plays hard though, and the real case was far from ideal. To get a skilled job you
do need a reasonable background (i.e job experience). This is a bit harder if
you try your luck abroad. And I didn't have <em>any</em> job experience.
Then I started doing whatever I found to make a living.</p> 
<p>The first job was as a waiter. 
Later on I worked as a barista (learnt on the go). After saving some money and about
3 months off the
start, I carefully resigned. To make the money last I set up a few volunteering jobs. For
those of you who never heard about it before, volunteerings consist on doing simple
tasks in exchange for bed and food. It's normally 2 to 4 hours a day and you can
choose what to do with the rest of the day. In my spare time I started studying
web development.</p>
<p>After 4 months (roughly) I knew the very basics of web development.
</p>
  <h3>A learning path</h3>
  <p><em>The hard task is not to get a book or a document about
  a topic but to get the right
  one.</em></p>
  <p>The first face to web development was at the Oxfordshire County Library. There were
               monthly meetings aimed to learn through <a
  title="It's a non-profit community run by smart Quincy Larson.
          It helps people to learn web dev by building projects."
          href="https://freecodecamp.org">Freecodecamp</a>, an amazing online
        community where you can learn coding for free.</p>
  <p>That was my main source of knowledge. Some other amazing sources were
  these Youtube
  channels:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/TechGuyWeb/videos" title="Link to
                 channel's video tab in Youtube">Traversymedia</a>: for intros to any web dev topic.</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/KepowOb/videos" title="Link to
                 channel's video tab in Youtube">Kevin Powell</a>: for CSS and Design in general.</li>
    <li><a
    href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClb90NQQcskPUGDIXsQEz5Q/videos"
    title="Link to channel's video tab in Youtube">DevEd</a>: for animations and creative thinking.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><em>Freecodecamp</em> (FCC from now on) does also have a <a
  href="https://freecodecamp.org/forum" title="You can ask
                                       for help with exercises or coding
                                       challenges, advices, coding strategies and
                                       habits.">forum</a> where you can post your
  questions. For more specific questions there is <em>Stackoverflow</em>. There
  are also chat platforms. I didn't use these much till 2020 when someone
                                        showed me <a
                                             href="https://about.riot.im/">Riot</a>
                                        a web client for Matrix.

  </p>
  <p>If you want to know <em>exactly</em> what software you need to
  start off,
  check out
  this <a
         href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/installing_basic_software">Mozilla
         docs page</a>.
   <h3>Some Humble Advices</h3>
  <p>The learning path is endless. So we have to build up websites as we go. 
  Do active learning, build projects, avoid too much passive learning. 
  I recommend to learn HTML, the basics of CSS and start coding right away. In my personal case I tried out some of FCC's projects, emulated mozilla docs for my own stuff, 
copied websites. I'd recommend you to try those out too.
</p>
  <p>I'd then, let's say on the 5th month, got into 
  Vanilla Javascript. Try to become productive before becoming good at it. 
But if you repeat 3 lines of code instead
  of using a for-loop that's perfectly fine. You can always refactor or edit
  your code later on.
  One of the main reasons to learn javascript is animations.</p>
  <h3>Looking for a Job</h3>
  <p>This is a tough part. I haven't find a job, not even as a freelancer. The
  reason being that there are many advanced coders and many company's
  prerequisites for a junior entry-level job are awfully high.</p>
  <p>That's one of the reasons to write and share this blogpost, as
  there seems to be a misconception out there about how easy it is to find a job
  in web development. However, I've always find coding worth my time, it's
  a beautiful hobby much like music, reading or doing sport. I hope you will do too. Surely jobs
  will show up in due time.</p>
