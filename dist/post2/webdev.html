  <h2>Thoughts on Web Dev</h2>
  <p>On the beginning of 2019 I started studying web development on my own.
  It's not easy at all if you work and do stuff to make a living. You're tired,
  you forget what you've studied yesterday and get frustrated.</p> 
  <p>As many do, I feel empathetic for people running over the same
  experience, and think my testimony may be useful for some of you.</p>
  <h3>First try</h3>
  <p>I've always believed this question was an easy one: do what you
  like.</p>
  <p>It turns out to be rather difficult. I've Breath In and Breath Out deeply many
  times.</p>
<p>If it's the case that you like web development, and you build some spare
  hours out of nothing, then it's time to be efficient. I am not, but I try to
  be.
</p>
<h3>My take on this</h3>
<p> What I did was probably a bit extreme, but I'll share it with you, 
  just for the sake of having fun.</p>
<p>Some time ago I started travelling over the world with very little money. 
I was a chemist and thought it would be easy to find a job. Well it wasn't and
I was not so sure to make it my job. Then I got into basic programming and 
web development.</p>
<p>I worked in coffee shops, waitering, and so on. Only to resign after
3 months or so to study for
a while. And during this time, I did volunteerings, then the money lasted longer, 
and you always have spare hours to learn.
</p>
  <h3>Sources of knowledge</h3>
    <p>On this days the hard task is not to get a book, or a document about
  a topic but to get the right
  one.</p>
  <p>When I started studying it was because of <a
                                                 href='https://freecodecamp.org'>Freecodecamp</a>
  there were also group meetings on a library, and therein people  helped newbies out
  a lot. Almost any online forum covers the same. There are also Youtube
  channels
  like <em>Traversymedia</em>, <em>Kevin Powell</em>, <em>DevEd</em> that help
  a lot if you are starting up from nothing.</p> 
  <p><em>freecodecamp</em> does also have a forum where you can ask your
  questions. For more specific, general question there is <em>stackoverflow</em> and for sure
  there are <abbr>IRC</abbr> chat rooms or the new and super cool Matrix/Riot
  software to hangout with knowledgeable people and learn a lot from them.</p>
  <h3>What to learn?</h3>
  <p>I'd say learn HTML and CSS and start coding straight away. You can copy
  websites or learn simple stuff, code along with any Youtuber etc. I've always
  preferred to do all on my own. So I picked up a topic I was interested in and
  create a blog (after polishing my HTML, CSS/SASS skills to an intermediate
  level).</p>
  <p>I believe the next thing to learn is mastering an editor. If you have
  a powerful computer go for <em>vscode</em> otherwise use <em>vim</em>. I use
  <em>vim</em> but it takes longer than any other editor to learn it and be
  productive with it.</p>
  <p>I'd then, let's say on the 4th month, get into programming basics.
  Javascript and bash are absolutely useful. Knowing javascript you can go
  further to use gulp which is a workflow controller. It helps with repetitive
  tasks like compiling sass documents.</p>
  <h3>Looking for a Job</h3>
  <p>This is a tough part. I haven't find a job, not even as a freelancer. The
  reason being that many advanced coders are working both on industry and
  freelancing so it's not easy to find a job being a beginner.</p>
  <p>That's why you should learn coding only if you like, because unless you
  can spend a lot of hours per day learning or learn things very fast, it will
  take long.</p>
