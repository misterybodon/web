Many complex concepts we use come from old times, or different contexts where and even if not, they occur in the mind of a single human, or a few of them. 

The point here is: many concepts we learn make no sense. Every now and then, I will write a post about one of such concepts. 

Every now and then we play a sort of game with a friend. Or I should say we just 
like to imagine things together. The game consiste in *reinventing the world*. But let me explain what this really is. 

Reinventing the world means to try to understand how some concepts and rules 
came to be. Not with historical precision though.

So the proper term might be 're imagine the world' such that  make sense for us, even if this differs from original definitions.

A topic could be Pythagoras' relationship for triangles, which is not really about triangles but about squares. Anyways, we tend to know 
whether the formula is useful or not for a particular problem, but not to grasp it any further. We know how to use it, and when to apply something, but there is not real picture in our minds, such that when we face the unknown, we doubt. 
**We are searching for that picture.** Every now and then a complex idea finally appears as something simple. 

[This is far from a critique to institutes, but an invitation to ride off-road for a while]

This time I was staying at a hostel and there were no fridges available. So I put the cheese at the window. Of course, although It wasn't too hot, it melted down -that was no trouble, I ate it. But there was a piece of meat on the side. And so I thought: oh, maybe it's not a good idea to eat this fish cake. Then imagination started taking over. 

Let's say in a parallel world people use cheese as a measure of meat putrefaction. Someone suggests to use butter also, as a kind of "warning this will be gone soon". - We humans love this tools, they make life easier. One day, someone finds out a new substance that is so awesome as to replace both the cheese and the butter. Why? Because it's normally green, but when butter melts, it turns to orange, and when cheese melts it turns red. That's a thermometer; a simple one. 

A thermometer is a cool substance that indicates when butter melts, when cheese melts, and when many other substances change. The important bit here is to know the height. We are now sorrounded things complex enough that we need this kind of example to get them back in our hands. 

Let's go a bit further in. After many years tinkering with Mercury, the nice compound that we use to prevent food putrefaction, we find out that if we have two thermometers each one in a vessel full of water, and the height is different, once they are connected by any material (well, a conductor) the height tends to equilibrate somewhere between the 2 Ts. 

That's just the start. If the mass is the same, but the initial height is different, the final height will be exactly in the middle of the differences in the heights. If the mass is not the same though the difference in the heights of 2 mercury-devices between an initial and a final step is will be closely related to the difference in the mass. If the substances are different, we can still find out how this height will change. And we are just speaking about height, mass, and the type of substance. 

In the end, it boils down to concrete examples and time.
