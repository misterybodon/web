                        <h2>The concept of Temperature</h2>
                        <p>
                        Many abstract concepts we learn make no sense for us at first glance. Every now and then, I will write a post about one of such concepts. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        And every now and then we play a sort of game with a friend. Or I should say we just 
                        like to imagine and wonder about things together.
                        A topic could be Pythagoras' relationship for triangles, which is not really about triangles but about squares. Anyways, we tend to know whether the formula is useful or not for a particular problem, but not to grasp it any further. We know <em>how to use it</em>, but there is no deep picture in our minds.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        <p>
                        This time I was staying at a hostel and there were no fridges available. So I put the cheese at the window. Of course, although it wasn't too hot, scottish summer melted it down -that was no trouble, I ate it. But there was a piece of meat on the side. And so I thought: Oh, maybe it's not a good idea to eat this fish cake. Then imagination started taking over. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Let's say in a parallel world people use the melt of cheese as an indicator that meat will be bad soon. Someone suggests to use butter also, as a kind of <span class="section__spanWarning">warning:</span> we're close to melt the cheese. We humans love this tools, they make life easier. If the butter melts, you can either eat the meat or put it on a cooler place. 
                        If the cheese melts you better throw it away.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        One day though, someone finds a new substance that could potentially replace both the cheese and the butter. <em>Why?</em> Because it's normally green, but when butter melts, it turns to orange, and when cheese melts it turns red. And that's a thermometer; a simple one. The state of a substance tells us about the state of other substances. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        A thermometer is a cool substance that indicates when butter melts, when cheese melts, and when many other substances change. The important bit in our thermometers is not the color but <em>the height</em>. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        After many years tinkering with Mercury, we find out that if we have two thermometers - one on each vessel full of water, and the initial height is different, once they are connected by any material (well, a conductor) the height tends to equilibrate somewhere between the two heights. 
                        To be more precise, if the <em>mass is the same</em>, but the initial height is different, the final height will exactly be (height1 + height2)/2 . Believe it or not, we are calculating a temperature. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        If the <em>mass is not the same</em> though, the difference in the heights of 2 mercury-devices between an initial and a final step is will depend on the mass-difference. In a general case, <em>If the substances, the initial height and the masses are different</em>, we can still find out how this height will change. And we are just speaking about height, mass, and the type of substance. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        With some effort, the concept of sensible heat can be derived, which is the variation in the height of 
                        a thermometer on a substance due to another substance. But this is the topic of another post.
                        <p>
                        In the end, it boils down to concrete examples and time.
                        </p>
