        <h2>The Blog</h2>
        <p>You'll find songs, thought-vomits, poems, 
        scientific articles, pictures, philosophical ramblings. It may seem
        more than one person is writing, sometimes contradicting themselves.
        That's how it is. 
        </p>
        <p>
        <em>Do I contradict myself? <br/> Very well, then I contradict
          myself,<br/> I am
          large, I contain multitudes.</em>
        </p>
      </section>
  <h2>The Person</h2>
  <p>The section should probably be called <em>Who am I?</em>. 
  Mister Nobody reborns every now and then. It's not a new body 
  with an inherited psyque, it's the same body with new mindset. And 
  it's not even the same body. It's not A or B, or not A or not B. It's
  somewhere in the middle vibrating chaotically.
</p>
  <p>These days I've been travelling. This is a good opportunity for reborns.
When we arrive to a new place nobody knows us, then we can be whatever we want. 
Mr. Nobody is addicted to it. (Apologizes if I mix first and third person,
sometimes I find it easier to take distance of the first person when writing or
even when speaking.) I don't practize this reborns as intensely as I dream of,
but it's getting closer with time.</p>
  <h3>But, but what's the point of it pal?</h3>
  <p>It is to understand what life is. For me, life is a marvel that must be
  seen from different angles to get a deeper understanding of it. Every reborn
 opens up a new world of possibility, another door is open in the endless 
 corridor. 
  </p>
  <p>I don't think there is a reason for this behaviour though, I just do it, and Like
  it. I am an experiment, I feel the adreline of the unknown, fear and joy, life
  showing up to me on its own law and power. This seems to me the only way to
  go, even if dying young is the pay.</p>
  <h3>Why not to use your real name then?</h3>
  <p>Mr Nobody is not just me. It's showing up a very common mindset and way of
  being from this times. With some variation, of course. Mr Nobody has troubles
  to understand <em>Why life is as it is?</em>, <em>Why did it all start</em>,
  <em>Why there is so much suffering</em>. Mister Nobody can't understand there is
  no Ethics written in the bare bones of the Universe, he fights against the
  obvious absense of meaning and fears to be a piece of an universal
  chessboard. If we look carefully, <em>there is nothing but emptiness.</em></section>

        <h2>Are you a Nobody?</h2>
        <p>        This is a bit off here. It's here though.
        There is a key test for Mr Nobody's detection. Do you take yourself
        seriously? 
        If you are, you already know the answer.
