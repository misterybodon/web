    <h2>Some Clarifications</h2>
    <p>I am Mister Nobody i.e, the one who writes. As you will find, I mix
    first and third person. The reason being that Mr.
    Nobody is just a sample of thousands of them spread all over the globe.
    Sometimes I call them <em>The Nobodies</em>. 
    When writing, I see myself as a part of this collection along
    with some variations, then you'll find both He and I interleaved in the
    text.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="article__brief">
    <h2>Brief</h2>
<p>Mr. Nobody knows many things, none of them in depth. He has a
        natural tendency for abstract thinking, art and irony. Irony helps to
        deal with the intrinsic paradox of the world, and to avoid taking
        himself too seriously.
      </p>

    <section class="article__profile" id="profile">
      <h2>Methamorphosis of Mr. Nobody</h2>
            <p>
      Mr. Nobody starts to develop when the seed of doubt opens up. 
      At an early stage he doubts
      about anything and everything. Across the first couple of years doubt
      takes over his mind and temper. Mr. Nobody now vacillates, is shy and
      solitaire. Meanwhile most of the reading and thinking about
      life goes on. The apparent lack of a True Order conduces him to anxiety
      and confusion. He finds himself Samsa-like. Nobody 
has no choice but to look for help on psychology, religion, meditation.
</p>
      <p>Next stage in the methamorphosis finds a highly detached individual (in a materialistic
        sense) but this detachment doesn't necessarily imply egoism: Mr.
        Nobody likes helping others just for the sake of helping.
      </p>
        <p>
Nobodies need to know what exactly defines good or bad, right or
        wrong, why some things are supposed to produce sadness or happiness; 
what does it mean for something to be true or false or none of those. And the 
wanderings go further and further. It's not curiosity but desperation for
knowing. Topics like <em>What is an answer? What is
  a question?</em> become frequent,
meditation becomes substantial.</p>
       <p>Late on this second stage Mr. Nobody becomes an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absurdism">absurdist</a> but
        as a side effect he seeks for meaning on every chink of the world.
    He comes to some conclusions though. There are no
        right feelings; mind is built in our own develop as organisms and it
        can be changed. [However, the very concept of mind is a living issue. 
        Mr. Nobody is a materialist and for him, mind is a complex biological
        process. We may say <em>bend</em> the mind, as we bend an arm.] There is no meaning or purpose but ours; colectively, meaning
       and purpose are not out there, they're an agreement. Free will is
       a myth, we are a flow of the universe dictated by laws. Science is
       a living curiosity and a wonderful tool. You shouldn't take
       yourself, your thoughts or ideas any serious.</p>
      <p>
        On a third phase those wanderings are less frequent, this is not
        because of answers to previous questions, but because they are perceived in
        a different way. Suffering leads
        to wisdom about life. Mind is now calmer. Contradiction, fear, joy, all
        live together - as if they were out there,
        loosely related to myself. This new Mr. Nobody feels essential to keep an eye on
      the present moment.</p>
      <p>Take a deep breath.
There is more to be said but I won't
        extend longer.       </p>

        I am another puppet, an example case. I've studied a little bit of music,
        literature, philosophy, languages, science,
        programming. This website is an attempt to show what's going on inside
