  <h2>Thoughts on Web Dev</h2>
  <p>In the beginning of 2019 I started studying web development on my own.
  Not an easy task if you work and do stuff to make a living. You're tired,
  you forget what you've studied yesterday and get frustrated.</p> 
  <p>As many do, I feel empathetic for people running over the same
  experience, and think my testimony could be helpful for some of you.</p>

  <h3>Background</h3>
<p>In March 2019 I was a fresh graduate bored of books and looking for new people, new
experiences, new everything. So I started backpacking around the globe. 
Being a chemist by training, I thought it easy to get a temporary
contract for a chemistry-job either at home or abroad. Then I could travel and
chill more. That's
was, very vaguely, the plan.</p>
<p>Reality plays hard though. To get a skilled job you
do need a reasonable background (i.e job experience). This is a bit harder if
you try your luck abroad. And I didn't have any job experience.
So I started doing whatever I found.</p> 
<p>The first job was as a waiter. 
Later on as a barista (learnt on the go). After saving some money, about
3 months off the
start, I resigned. To make the money last I set up a few volunteering jobs. For
those of you who never heard about it before, volunteerings consist on doing some simple
tasks in exchange for bed and food. It's normally 2 to 4 hours a day and you can
choose what to do with the rest of the day. In my free time I started studying
web development.</p>
<p>After a couple of volunteerings I knew the very basics of web development.
It took me around 4 months to learn just Hypertext Markup
Language or HTML, Cascade Stylesheets or CSS and Syntactically Awesome
Style Sheets or SASS. I might write a post about these at some point.</p>
  <h3>A learning path</h3>
  <p><em>On these days the hard task is not to get a book, or a document about
  a topic but to get the right
  one.</em></p>
  <p>The first face to web development was at the Oxfordshire County Library. There were
               monthly meetings aimed to learn using <a
  title="It's a non-profit community run by smart Quincy Larson.
          It helps people to learn web dev by building projects."
          href="https://freecodecamp.org">Freecodecamp</a>. I didn't even know what web
  development was. They introduced us to this
                       amazing online community where you can learn coding for free
                       (just to make it crystal clear, it was <a
  title="check out freecodecamp! It's a non-profit thing run by a very cool and
           smart guy." href="https://freecodecamp.org">Freecodecamp</a>).
         You don't really need any
         group meeting to learn (but it's advisable to attend if you have the
         chance to do it).</p>
  <p>That was my main source of knowledge. Some other amazing sources were
  these Youtube
  channels:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li><em>Traversymedia</em>: for intros to any web dev topic.</li>
    <li><em>Kevin Powell</em>: for CSS and Design in general.</li>
    <li><em>DevEd</em>: for animations and creative thinking.</li>
  </ol>

  <p><em>Freecodecamp</em> (FCC from now on) does also have a <a
  href="https://freecodecamp.org/forum" title="You can ask
                                       for help with exercises or coding
                                       challenges, advices, coding strategies and
                                       habits.">forum</a> where you can ask your
  questions. For more specific questions there is <em>stackoverflow</em>. There
  are also chat platforms. I didn't use those much till 2020 when someone
                                        showed me <a
                                             href="https://about.riot.im/">Riot</a>
                                        a web client for <a
                                                           href="https://matrix.org">Matrix</a>.
I just love this platform.                                                         
  </p>
  <h3>Some Humble Advices</h3>
  <p>The learning path is infinite. So we have to build up websites as we go. 
  Do active learning, build projects, avoid too much passive learning. 
  Try copying a website (source code is only two clicks far!), 
a freecodecamp project, a webpage for something you're interested in, code
along with youtubers. 
In my personal case I've have done most of FCC projects, emulate mozilla docs for my own stuff, 
copied websites and lately build up this blog.</p> 
  <p>I recommend to learn HTML, the basics of CSS and start coding right away. </p>
  <p>I believe the next thing to learn is mastering an editor. If you have
  a powerful computer go for <em>vscode</em> otherwise use <em>vim</em>.</p>
  <p>I'd then, let's say on the 4th month, get into programming and scripting
  basics.
  Knowing Javascript you can go
  further to use Gulp which is a workflow controller. It helps with repetitive
  tasks like compiling SASS documents.</p>
  <h3>Looking for a Job</h3>
  <p>This is a tough part. I haven't find a job, not even as a freelancer. The
  reason being that there are many advanced coders so it's not easy to find
  a job for a beginner.</p>
  <p>That's why, I believe, you should only learn to code if you really enjoy it.</p>
